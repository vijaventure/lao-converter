# Introduction

Lao Romanization Converter is a tool that helps you convert a text from Lao to Roman script, a process called romanization or transliteration.

## Background

This web service was developed to automate the romanisation of Lao names for official use. The World Health Organization (WHO) has been involved in standardising health facility names for the Ministry of Health (MOH), Lao PDR, and it was recommended to develop software to convert 1,000+ names in Lao and many more in other sectors.


## Romanization System - MOH 2020

Currently there is no official national romanization system for the Lao language in Lao PDR.
Different government entities, donors, the private sector and general public are using different romanisation standards, mixture of them or other unclear and informal rules.
MoH and WHO identified this problem since 2019 and agreed to develop a new official romanisation system for the health sector, which was drafted later that year.
